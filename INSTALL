NCL Bindings 1.0

INSTALL

 NCL Bindings building require some additional tools and components:

 * SWIG (at least version 1.3)
 * CMake (at least version 2.0)
 * NCL (at least version 2.0 sourcecode)

 To build NCL Bindings you need to employ CMake to generate the
adequate building instructions (v.gr. Makefiles). The instructions
produced by CMake will target the building of bindings for the
language indicated by the build directory name. If CMake detects the
build directory (which can be it from which CMake was invoked or that
indicated on the CMake options) has the name python, it will produce
instructions for building of the Python version of bindings.

 Once you run sucessfully CMake, the proper building instructions for
your platform will be inside the build directory. Then you just need
to employ this building instructions for compiling the bindings. If you
get a Makefile, you can use make, and if you get a Visual Studio
project you can employ VS to make the respective.

 The building of Perl, Python and Ruby bindings will produce one or
two files with the following names: ncl.pm and ncl.so (Perl), ncl.py
and _ncl.so (Python), and ncl.so (Ruby).

 Before you can employ NCL Bindings you need to move or copy the
files produced to the respective place for each language so the
bindings can be seen and imported from programs. Please consult the
documentation of each language to know the right system path.
